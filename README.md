# Forecasting atmospheric CO2 levels between now and 2060

Since 1958 atmospheric carbon dioxide measurements have been recorded at the Mauna Loa Observatory in
Hawaii. CO2 levels have been increasing steadily since the start of the industrial revolution in the 18th century. Older data are from ice core measurements, not
atmospheric measurements. The data from Mauna Loa provide very direct data on atmospheric CO2, which forms an important part of global climate change modeling. We  use the weekly Mauna Loa data set from the Scripps CO2 program.

I create a statistical model that explains this data set well and to use it to forecast what measurements will look like between now and the start of 2060 â€“ 40 years from now. The model reflects the uncertainty in your predictions, showing confidence intervals widening as we go further away from the present time. I also use the model to predict when we are likely to reach high-risk levels of CO2 with a greater probability of serious climate change--tipping points.
